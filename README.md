# MP Project XO Documentation ✨🤖🎮

## 1. Hardware Part: Robotic Arm 🦾🔧⚙️

We will use a **3D-printed robotic arm** with **3 degrees of freedom**. This arm will:
1. Print each part individually.
2. Assemble the full arm.
3. Utilize **three MG90S servo motors** for horizontal/vertical arm movement and **one additional motor** for rotations. 🤖🛠️🎯

### Custom Design 🎨🔩🕹️
We will replace the standard end-effector (gripper) with a **custom design** that supports different attachments, including an **electromagnet for the Tic-Tac-Toe game**. 🧲🎲🕹️
